LDC Analysis
==============
Analysis of timeseries electricity demand data from a local distribution 
company (LDC) for the purposes of my research. It is currently just a 
workspace against a private database. 

Though I'm developing with an Apache 2.0 
License, I'm doubtful that this project is very useful to others currently.

Depends on django, numpy, scipy, and matplotlib. Written for Python 3.x.
